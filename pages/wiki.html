    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The first version of Anna University formed in 1978 and various governments repeatedly kept changing the
        varsity's structure and affiliation scope. In 2001, under the Anna University Amendment Act of 2001, the
        erstwhile Anna University became an affiliating university, taking under its wings all the engineering colleges
        in Tamil Nadu. This included six government engineering colleges, three government-aided private institutions,
        and 426 self-financing colleges. On 1 February 2007, as a result of a Government of Tamil Nadu decision, the
        university was split into six constituent universities: Anna University, Chennai, Anna University of Technology,
        Chennai, Anna University of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore, Anna
        University of Technology Tirunelveli and Anna University of Technology, Madurai.[4] The institutes were formally
        created in 2010. On 14 September 2011, a bill was passed to merge back the universities.[5] The merger became
        final in August 2012.[6]

        <br> In 2011 and 2012 the constituents were merged back to a single affiliating university and the four regional
        universities continue to function as regional campus of the university.

    <h2>Admissions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A common entrance test – the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE) – was used as a basis
        for admission to professional courses in the state until 2006.[7] Starting in the academic year 2007–08,
        students were admitted to engineering colleges on the basis of their higher secondary marks.[8] Post-graduate
        admission process is carried out through TANCET and GATE scores.[9]

    </p>

    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The university offers courses in engineering and technology through its affiliated colleges and follows a dual
        semester system. Every year the university conducts examinations for even semester in May–June and for odd
